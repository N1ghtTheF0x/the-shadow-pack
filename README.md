# The Shadow Pack

![Pack icon](./textures/pack.png)

A texture/resource pack for any version of Minecraft that I use

## Changes to vanilla

- every GUI interface is black with 1 pixel white borders

## Setup

```sh
npm install # or pnpm install, yarn [install]
npm run build # or pnpm build, yarn build
```

This will create packs for Minecraft:

- `pre-1.6` (aka Texture Pack)

These packs will be located in the `out` directory
